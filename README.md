# Advanced-Time-series-analysis

Hybrid models are one of the most widely-used hybrid models that in which a time series
is assumed to be composed of two linear and nonlinear components. In this project, the
performance of two types of these hybrid models is evaluated for predicting stock prices in order
to introduce the more reliable series hybrid model. For this purpose, ARIMA, LSTM and MLPs
are elected for constructing hybrid models. Empirical results for forecasting data sets indicate
that despite of more popularity of the conventional ARIMA-LSTM model, the ARIMA-MLP
hybrid model can overall achieved more accurate results.
